title: A sum-product algorithm with polynomials for computing exact derivatives of
  the likelihood in Bayesian networks
abstract: We consider a Bayesian network with a parameter $\theta$. It is well known
  that the probability of an \emph{evidence} conditional on $\theta$ (the likelihood)
  can be computed through a sum-product of potentials. In this work we propose a polynomial
  version of the sum-product algorithm based on generating functions for computing
  both the likelihood function and all its exact derivatives. For a unidimensional
  parameter we obtain the derivatives up to order $d$ with a complexity $\mathcal{O}
  (C \times d^2)$ where $C$ is the complexity for computing the likelihood alone.
  For a parameter of $p$ dimensions we obtain the likelihood, the gradient and the
  Hessian with a complexity $\mathcal{O} (C \times p^2)$. These complexities are similar
  to the numerical method with the main advantage that it computes exact derivatives
  instead of approximations.
