title: "Who Learns Better Bayesian Network Structures: Constraint-Based, Score-based or Hybrid Algorithms?"
abstract: "The literature groups algorithms to learn the structure of Bayesian networks
  from data in three separate classes: <i>constraint-based algorithms</i>, which
  use conditional independence tests to learn the dependence structure of the data;
  <i>score-based algorithms</i>, which use goodness-of-fit scores as objective 
  functions to maximise; and <i>hybrid algorithms</i> that combine both approaches. 
  Famously, Cowell (2001) showed that algorithms in the first two classes learn 
  the same structures when the topological ordering of the network is known and 
  we use entropy to assess conditional independence and goodness of fit. In this
  paper we address the complementary question: how do these classes of algorithms
  perform outside of the assumptions above? We approach this question by recognising
  that structure learning is defined by the combination of a <i>statistical 
  criterion</i> and an <i>algorithm</i> that determines how the criterion is applied 
  to the data. Removing the confounding effect of different choices for the 
  statistical criterion, we find using both simulated and real-world data that 
  constraint-based algorithms do not appear to be more efficient or more sensitive 
  to errors than score-based algorithms; and that hybrid algorithms are not faster 
  or more accurate than constraint-based algorithms. This suggests that commonly 
  held beliefs on structure learning in the literature are strongly influenced by 
  the choice of particular statistical criteria rather than just properties of the 
  algorithms themselves."
