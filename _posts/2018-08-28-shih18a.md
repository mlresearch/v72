title: Formal Verification of Bayesian Network Classifiers
abstract: A new approach was recently proposed for {\em explaining} the decisions
  made by Bayesian network classifiers. This approach is based on first compiling
  a given classifier (i.e., its decision function) into a tractable representation
  called an Ordered Decision Diagram (ODD). Given an ODD representation of the decision
  function, we get the ability to provide reasons for why a classifier labels a given
  instance positively or negatively. We show in this paper that this approach also
  gives us the ability to {\em verify} the behavior of classifiers. We also provide
  case studies in explaining and verifying classifiers for some real-world domains,
  such as in medical diagnosis and educational assessment.
