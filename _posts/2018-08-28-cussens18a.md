title: Markov Random Field MAP as Set Partitioning
abstract: The Markov Random Field (MRF) MAP inference problem is considered from the
  viewpoint of integer programming (IP). The problem is shown to be a (pure) set partitioning
  problem (SPP). This allows us to bring existing work on SPP to bear on the MAP problem.
  Facets (maximally strong linear inequalities) of the closely related set packing
  (SP) problem are shown to be useful for MRF MAP. These facets include odd hole and
  odd anti-hole inequalities which are shown to be findable using a zero-half cut
  generator. Experimental results using CPLEX show that for MRF MAP problems, generating
  more zero-half cuts than normal typically brings performance improvements. Pre-processing
  methods to reduce the size of MRF MAP problems are also considered, and some preliminary
  results on their usefulness presented.
