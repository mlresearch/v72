title: Learning Optimal Causal Graphs with Exact Search
abstract: Discovering graphical models over very general model spaces with high accuracy
  requires optimally combining conflicting (in)dependence constraints in sample data,
  and thus results in a computationally hard combinatorial optimization problem. Recent
  advances in exact algorithmic approaches in this  constraint-based setting build
  upon off-the-shelf declarative optimization solvers. In this paper, we propose the
  first truly specialized exact search algorithm for optimal causal graphs in a general
  model space, allowing both cycles and latent confounding variables. Our problem-oriented
  approach enables directly incorporating domain knowledge for developing a wider
  range of specialized search techniques for the problem, including problem-specific
  propagators, branching heuristics, and bounding techniques, as well as directly
  incorporating different constraints on the model space, such as sparsity and acyclicity
  constraints. We empirically evaluate a first implementation of the approach, showing
  that it clearly outperforms current state of art in exact constraint-based causal
  discovery on real-world instances.
