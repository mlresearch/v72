title: Structure Learning for Bayesian Networks over Labeled DAGs
abstract: Graphical models based on labeled directed acyclic graphs (LDAGs) allow
  for representing context-specific independence relations in addition to regular
  conditional independencies. Modeling such constraints has been demonstrated to be
  important for expressiveness, interpretation and predictive ability. In this paper,
  we build theoretical results that make constraint-based and exact score-based structure
  discovery possible for this interesting model class.  In detail, we present the
  first constraint-based learning method for LDAGs. The orientation rules use context-specific
  independencies for principled orientation of additional (causal) edges. We also
  present the first exact score-based learning method for LDAGs, that employs a branch
  and bound for the especially computational demanding task of local score calculation,
  after which exact DAG search can be used. Simulations verify the good performance
  of our methods in different data analysis tasks.
