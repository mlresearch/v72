title: A partial orthogonalization method for simulating covariance and concentration
  graph matrices
abstract: 'Structure learning methods for covariance and concentration graphs are
  often validated on synthetic models, usually obtained by randomly generating: (i)
  an undirected graph, and (ii) a compatible symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix.
  In order to ensure positive definiteness in (ii), a dominant diagonal is usually
  imposed. However, the link strengths in the resulting graphical model, determined
  by off-diagonal entries in the SPD matrix, are in many scenarios extremely weak.
  Recovering the structure of the undirected graph thus becomes a challenge, and algorithm
  validation is notably affected. In this paper, we propose an alternative method
  which overcomes such problem yet yields a compatible SPD matrix. We generate a partially
  row-wise-orthogonal matrix factor, where pairwise orthogonal rows correspond to
  missing edges in the undirected graph. In numerical experiments ranging from moderately
  dense to sparse scenarios, we obtain that, as the dimension increases, the link
  strength we simulate is stable with respect to the structure sparsity. Importantly,
  we show in a real validation setting how structure recovery is greatly improved
  for all learning algorithms when using our proposed method, thereby producing a
  more realistic comparison framework.'
