title: A Novel Approach to Handle Inference in Discrete Markov Networks with Large
  Label Sets
abstract: 'MAP inference over discrete Markov networks with large label sets is often
  applied, e.g., in localizing multiple key points in the image domain. Often, approximate
  or domain specific methods are used to make the problem feasible. An alternative
  method is to preselect a limited (much smaller) set of suitable labels, which bears
  the risk to exclude the correct solution. To solve the latter problem, we propose
  a two-step approach: First, the reduced label sets are extended by a novel “refine”
  label, which — when chosen during inference — marks nodes where the label set is
  insufficient. The energies for this additional label are learned in conjunction
  with the network’s potential weights. Second, for all nodes marked with the “refine”
  label, additional local inference steps over the full label set are performed. This
  greedy refinement becomes feasible by extracting small subgraphs around the marked
  nodes and fixing all other nodes. We thoroughly evaluate and analyze our approach
  by solving the problem of localizing and identifying 16 posterior ribs in 2D chest
  radiographs.'
