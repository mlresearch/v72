title: Discrete model-based clustering with overlapping subsets of attributes
abstract: Traditional model-based clustering methods assume that data instances can
  be grouped in a single “best" way. This is often untrue for complex data, where
  several meaningful sets of clusters may exist, each of them associated to a unique
  subset of data attributes. Current literature has approached this problem with models
  that consider disjoint subsets of attributes to define distinct clustering solutions.
  Each solution being represented by a cluster variable. However, restricting attributes
  to a single cluster variable diminishes the expressiveness and quality of these
  models. For this reason, we propose a novel kind of models that allows cluster variables
  to have overlapping subsets of attributes between them. In order to learn these
  models, we propose to combine a search-based method with an attribute clustering
  procedure. Experimental results with both synthetic and real-world data show the
  utility of our approach and its competitiveness with the state-of-the-art.
