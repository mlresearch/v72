title: An Order-based Algorithm for Learning Structure of Bayesian Networks
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the problem learning structure of Bayesian networks
  from data. The problem of Bayesian networks structure learning (BNSL) takes a dataset
  as input and produces a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as the output. This problem
  is known to be NP-hard which is commonly solved using the heuristic methods. There
  are generally three main approaches to the BNSL problem: score-based , constraint-based
  and hybrid learning. We propose a new simple and fast algorithm for addressing BNSL
  problem. The proposed hybrid algorithm is based on a partial ordering learned from
  data. We reduce the super-exponential search space of structures to the smaller
  ordering space of nodes. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using some standard
  benchmark datasets and compare the results with those of some state-of-the-art algorithms.
  Finally, we show that our algorithm is competitive with recent algorithms.'
