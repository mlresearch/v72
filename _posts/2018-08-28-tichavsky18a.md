title: Representations of Bayesian networks by low-rank models
abstract: Conditional probability tables (CPTs) of discrete valued random variables
  may achieve high dimensions and Bayesian networks defined as the product of these
  CPTs may become intractable by conventional methods of BN inference because of their
  dimensionality. In many cases, however, these probability tables constitute tensors
  of relatively low rank. Such tensors can be written in the so-called Kruskal form
  as a sum of rank-one components. Such representation would be equivalent to adding
  one artificial parent to all random variables and deleting all edges between the
  variables. The most difficult task is to find such a representation given a set
  of marginals or CPTs of the random variables under consideration. In the former
  case, it is a problem of joint canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of a set of
  tensors. The latter fitting problem can be solved in a similar manner. We apply
  a recently proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which assures
  that the model has a probabilistic interpretation, i.e., that all elements of all
  factor matrices are nonnegative. We perform experiments with several well-known
  Bayesian networks.
