title: Solving M-Modes in Loopy Graphs Using Tree Decompositions
abstract: M-Modes is the problem of finding the top M labelings of a graphical model
  that are locally optimal. The state-of-the-art M-Modes algorithm is a heuristic
  search method that finds global modes by incrementally concatenating MAP solutions
  in local neighborhoods. The search method also relies on the guidance of a heuristic
  function to explore the most promising parts of the search space. However, due to
  the difficulty of coordinating mode search, heuristic function calculation and local
  MAP computation in general loopy graphs, the method was only implemented and tested
  on special graphical models such as trees or submodular grid graphs. This paper
  provides a more general implementation of the search method based on tree decompositions
  that is applicable to general loopy graphs. A tree decomposition allows a sequence
  of local subgraphs to be mapped to a set of sub-trees sweeping through the tree
  decomposition, thus enabling a smooth and efficient transition back and forth between
  mode search, heuristic functio
