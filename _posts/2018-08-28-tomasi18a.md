title: Forward-Backward Splitting for Time-Varying Graphical Models
abstract: Gaussian graphical models have received much attention in the last years,
  due to their flexibility and expression power. However, the optimisation of such
  complex models suffer from computational issues both in terms of convergence rates
  and memory requirements. Here, we present a forward-backward splitting (FBS) procedure
  for Gaussian graphical modelling of multivariate time-series which relies on recent
  theoretical studies ensuring convergence under mild assumptions. Our experiments
  show that a FBS-based implementation achieves, with very fast convergence rates,
  optimal results with respect to ground truth and standard methods for dynamical
  network inference. Optimisation algorithms which are usually exploited for network
  inference suffer from drawbacks when considering large sets of unknowns. Particularly
  for increasing data sets and model complexity, we argue for the use of fast and
  theoretically sound optimisation algorithms to be significant to the graphical modelling
  community.
