title: Circular Chain Classifiers
abstract: 'Chain Classifiers (CC) are an alternative for multi-label classification
  that is efficient and provides, in general, good results. However, it is not clear
  how to define the order of the chain. Different orders tend to produce different
  outcomes. We propose an extension to chain classifiers called “Circular Chain Classifiers"
  (CCC), in which the propagation of the classes of the previous binary classifiers
  is done iteratively in a circular way. After the first cycle, the predictions from
  the base classifiers are entered as additional attributes to the first one in the
  chain. This process continues for all the classifiers in the chain, and it is repeated
  for a prefixed number of cycles or until convergence. Using two datasets, we empirically
  established that CCC: (i) converges in few iterations (in general, 3 or 4), (ii)
  the initial order of the chain does not have a significant impact on the results.
  CCC performance was also compared against binary relevance and chain classifiers
  producing statistically superior results. The main contribution of CCC is its independence
  from the preestablished order of the chain, outperforming CC.'
