title: Exact learning augmented naive Bayes classifier
abstract: 'For classification problems, Bayesian networks are often used to infer
  a class variable when given feature variables. Earlier reports have described that
  classification accuracies of Bayesian networks achieved by maximizing the marginal
  likelihood (ML) were lower than those achieved by maximizing the conditional log
  likelihood (CLL) of a class variable given the feature variables. However, the reports
  stated no reason why CLL outperformed ML. Differences between the two scoresâ€™ performances
  in those earlier studies might depend on their respective learning algorithms: they
  were approximate learning algorithms, not exact ones. The present study compared
  the classification performances of Bayesian networks with exact learning using ML
  and those with approximate learning using CLL. Results demonstrate that the performance
  of Bayesian networks achieved by maximizing ML is not necessarily worse than that
  achieved by maximizing CLL. However, the results also show that classification accuracies
  with exact learning by ML are much worse than those by other methods when the class
  variable has numerous parents and few children. To resolve this difficulty, this
  study proposed exact learning augmented naive Bayes (ANB) using Markov blanket feature
  selection. Some comparison experiments demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms
  the other methods.'
