title: Naive Bayesian Classifiers with Extreme Probability Features
abstract: Despite their popularity, naive Bayesian classifiers are not well suited
  for real-world applications involving extreme probability features.  As will be
  demonstrated in this paper, methods used to forestall the inclusion of zero probability
  parameters in naive classifiers have quite counterintuitive effects.  An elegant,
  principled solution for handling extreme probability events is available however,
  from coherent conditional probability theory.  We will show how this theory can
  be integrated in standard naive Bayesian classifiers, and then present a computational
  framework that retains the classifiersâ€™ efficiency in the presence of a limited
  number of extreme probability features.
