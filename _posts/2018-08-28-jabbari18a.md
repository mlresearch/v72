title: Instance-Specific Bayesian Network Structure Learning
abstract: Bayesian network (BN) structure learning algorithms are almost always designed
  to recover the structure that models \textit{the relationships that are shared by
  the instances in a population}. While accurately learning such population-wide Bayesian
  networks is useful, learning Bayesian networks that are specific to each instance
  is often important as well. For example, to understand and treat a patient (instance),
  it is critical to understand the specific causal mechanisms that are operating in
  that particular patient. We introduce an instance-specific BN structure learning
  method that searches the space of Bayesian networks to build a model that is specific
  to an instance by guiding the search based on attributes of the given instance (e.g.,
  patient symptoms, signs, lab results, and genotype). The structure discovery performance
  of the proposed method is compared to an existing state-of-the-art BN structure
  learning method, namely an implementation of the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm
  called FGES, using both simulated and real data. The results show that the proposed
  method improves the  precision of the model structure that is output, when compared
  to GES, especially for those variables that exhibit context-specific independence.
