title: Unifying DAGs and UGs
abstract: We introduce a new class of graphical models that generalizes Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg
  chain graphs by relaxing the semi-directed acyclity constraint so that only directed
  cycles are forbidden. Moreover, up to two edges are allowed between any pair of
  nodes. Specifically, we present local, pairwise and global Markov properties for
  the new graphical models and prove their equivalence. We also present an equivalent
  factorization property.
