title: Simple Propagation with Arc-Reversal in Bayesian Networks
abstract: Simple Propagation is a recently introduced algorithm for inference in discrete
  Bayesian networks using message passing in a junction tree. Simple Propagation is
  similar to Lazy Propagation, but uses the simple {\itshape one in, one out}-principle
  when computing messages between cliques of the junction tree instead of using a
  more in-depth graphical analysis of the set of potentials. In this paper, we describe
  how to apply Arc-Reversal (AR) as the marginalization algorithm during message passing
  in Simple Propagation.  We consider both discrete and hybrid Bayesian networks,
  where the continuous variables are assumed to be Conditional Linear Gaussian (CLG).
  The use of AR eliminates the need for complex matrix operations in case of CLG networks,
  while offering opportunities to exploit additional independence and irrelevance
  properties in both cases when compared to Variable Elimination (VE).  The performance
  of Simple Propagation with AR has been evaluated on a set of real-world Bayesian
  networks with discrete variables and hybrid Bayesian networks constructed by randomly
  replacing discrete variables with continuous variables under the CLG constraints.
  The performance of Simple Propagation with AR is compared with the performance of
  Lazy Propagation with AR. The results of the experimental performance analysis of
  Simple Propagation with AR are encouraring.
