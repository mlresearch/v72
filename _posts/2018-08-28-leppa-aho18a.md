title: Learning Non-parametric Markov Networks with Mutual Information
abstract: We propose a method for learning Markov network structures for continuous
  data without assuming any particular parametric distribution for the variables.
  The method makes use of previous work on a non-parametric estimator for mutual information
  which is used to create a non-parametric test for multivariate conditional independence.
  This independence test is then combined with an efficient constraint-based algorithm
  for learning the graph structure. The performance of the method is evaluated on
  several synthetic data sets and it is shown to learn more accurate structures than
  competing methods when the dependencies between the variables involve non-linearities.
