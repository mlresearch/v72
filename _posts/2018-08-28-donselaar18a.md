title: Parameterized hardness of active inference
abstract: Within the field of cognitive neuroscience, predictive processing is an
  increasingly popular unifying account of cognitive capacities including action and
  perception which posits that these rely on probabilistic generative models to predict
  sensory input or the consequences of one’s behaviour. In the corresponding literature
  one frequently encounters naive claims about the computational resources required
  to successfully employ such models, while actual complexity analyses are often lacking.
  In this paper we study the problem of selecting a course of action which yields
  the greatest reduction in prediction error between the intended outcome and the
  current state, known in this area as \textit{active inference}. Modelling the problem
  in terms of Bayesian networks and the relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence)
  between a target and an induced distribution, we derive parameterized (in)tractability
  results extending the $\mathsf{NP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$-hardness classification found
  in Kwisthout 2014. These show that contrary to common belief, the size of the prediction
  error does not determine whether active inference is tractable, not even when the
  number of actions and outcomes to be considered is restricted. Moreover, this conclusion
  appears to extend even to an approximate version of the problem. We believe these
  results can be of interest to both cognitive scientists seeking to evaluate the
  plausibility of their explanatory theories, and to researchers working on probabilistic
  models, as they relate to existing work on the hardness of observation selection
  in decision making.
