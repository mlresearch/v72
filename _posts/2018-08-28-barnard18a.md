title: Causal Structure Learning via Temporal Markov Networks
abstract: Learning the structure of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is a common way
  of discovering causal relationships in time series data. However, the combinatorial
  nature of DBN structure learning limits the accuracy and scalability of DBN modeling.
  We propose to avoid these limits by learning structure with log-linear temporal
  Markov networks (TMNs). Using TMNs replaces the combinatorial optimization problem
  with a continuous, convex one, which can be solved quickly with gradient methods.
  Furthermore, representing the data in terms of features gives TMNs an advantage
  in modeling the dynamics of sequences with irregular, sparse, or noisy events. Compared
  to representative DBN structure learners, TMNs run faster while performing as accurately
  on synthetic tasks and a real-world task of causal discovery in electronic medical
  records.
