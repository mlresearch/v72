title: Making Continuous Time Bayesian Networks More Flexible
abstract: The time duration in continuous time Bayesian networks, i.e., the time that
  a variable stays in a state until it transitions to another state, follows an exponential
  distribution. The exponential distribution is widely applied to describe the waiting
  time between events in a Poisson process, which describes the distribution of the
  number of events in one unit of time. This distribution is parameterized by a single
  rate and has mode zero, implying that the highest probability mass for events to
  happen is attributed to the earliest times. To describe biological processes, the
  exponential distribution is not always natural.  For example, if the immune system
  has not encountered a pathogen before, it most likely responds to a viral infection
  after a few days, rather than immediately.  In this paper, we generalize our recently
  proposed hypoexponential continuous time Bayesian networks, by allowing any number
  of hypoexponential variables, i.e., variables having a hypoexponential time duration
  distribution. In addition, we propose and compare two learning methods to estimate
  parameters for the generalized models. Finally, the practical value of the generalized
  models is demonstrated by means of a realistic medical problem.
