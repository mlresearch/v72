title: Finding Minimal Separators in LWF Chain Graphs
abstract: We address the problem of finding a minimal separator in a LWF chain graph,
  namely,  finding a set $Z$ of nodes that separates a given non-adjacent pair of
  nodes such that no proper subset of $Z$ separates that pair. We analyze several
  versions of this problem and offer polynomial time algorithms for each. These include
  finding a minimal separator from a restricted set of nodes, finding a minimal separator
  for two given disjoint sets, and testing whether a given separator is minimal.
