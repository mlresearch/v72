title: Approximating the maximum weighted decomposable graph problem with applications
  to probabilistic graphical models
abstract: In this work we deal with the problem of learning a maximum weighted $(k
  + 1)$-order decomposable graph coarser than a given maximal $k$-order decomposable
  graph (also known as hypertree of tree-width $k-1$). An Integer Linear Programming
  formulation for the problem has recently been proposed and used in order to solve
  instances of the problem with a moderate number of vertices. However, as the problem
  is known to be NP-hard, it is of practical interest to develop approximate algorithms
  able to work with a limited amount of computational resources. In this paper we
  propose an approximate Integer Linear Programming formulation for the problem using
  a threshold distance which discards the edges that, on average, have a low probability
  of being contained in the solution. Experiments have been carried out with weighted
  graphs and probabilistic graphical models. Using the proposed formulation we have
  obtained results close to the optimum, even when most of the candidate edges were
  discarded using the distance criterion. The obtained good results indicate that
  the approximate formulation has important applications for learning probabilistic
  graphical models using decomposable scores, e.g., BDe.
