title: Parallel Probabilistic Inference by Weighted Model Counting
abstract: Knowledge compilation as part of the Weighted Model Counting approach has
  proven to be an efficient tool for exact inference in probabilistic graphical models,
  by exploiting structures that more traditional methods can not. The availability
  of affordable high performance commodity hardware has been an inspiration for other
  inference approaches to exploit parallelism, to great suc- cess. In this paper,
  we explore the possibilities for Weighted Model Counting. We have empirically confirmed
  that exploited parallelism yields substantial speedups using a set of real-world
  Bayesian networks.
