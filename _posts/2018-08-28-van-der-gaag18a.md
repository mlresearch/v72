title: A Lattice Representation of Independence Relations
abstract: Independence relations in general include exponentially many statements
  of independence, that is, exponential in terms of the number of variables involved.  These
  relations are typically fully characterised however, by a small set of such statements
  and an associated set of derivation rules. While various computational problems
  on independence relations can be solved by manipulating these smaller sets without
  the need to explicitly generate the full relation, existing algorithms are still
  associated with often prohibitively high running times.  In this paper, we introduce
  a lattice representation for sets of independence statements, which provides further
  insights in the structural properties of independence and thereby renders the algorithms
  for some well-known problems on independence relations less demanding.  By means
  of experimental results, in fact, we demonstrate a substantial gain in efficiency
  of closure computation of semi-graphoid independence relations.
