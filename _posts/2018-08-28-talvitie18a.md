title: Finding Optimal Bayesian Networks with Local Structure
abstract: The idea of using decision trees as local models in Bayesian networks is
  revisited. A class of dyadic decision trees—proposed previously only for continuous
  conditioning variables—is augmented by incorporating categorical variables with
  arbitrary context-specific recursive splitting of their state spaces. It is shown
  that the resulting model class admits computationally feasible maximization of a
  Bayes score in a range of moderate-size problem instances. In particular, it enables
  global optimization of the Bayesian network structure, including the local structure,
  using state-of-the-art exact algorithms.  The paper also introduces a related model
  class that extends ordinary conditional probability tables to continuous variables
  by employing an adaptive discretization approach.  The two model classes are compared
  empirically by learning Bayesian networks from benchmark real-world and synthetic
  data sets. The relative strengths of the model classes are discussed.
