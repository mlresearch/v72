title: Discriminative Training of Sum-Product Networks by Extended Baum-Welch
abstract: We present a discriminative learning algorithm for Sum-Product Networks
  (SPNs) \citep{poon2011sum} based on the Extended Baum-Welch (EBW) algorithm \citep{baum1970maximization}.  We
  formulate the conditional data likelihood in the SPN framework as a rational function,
  and we use EBW to monotonically maximize it. We derive the algorithm for SPNs with
  both discrete and continuous variables. The experiments show that this algorithm
  performs better than both generative Expectation-Maximization, and discriminative
  gradient descent on a wide variety of applications. We also demonstrate the robustness
  of the algorithm in the case of missing features by comparing its performance to
  Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks.
