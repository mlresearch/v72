title: A Bayesian Approach for Inferring Local Causal Structure in Gene Regulatory
  Networks
abstract: Gene regulatory networks play a crucial role in controlling an organismâ€™s
  biological processes, which is why there is significant interest in developing computational
  methods that are able to extract their structure from high-throughput genetic data.
  A typical approach consists of a series of conditional independence tests on the
  covariance structure meant to progressively reduce the space of possible causal
  models. We propose a novel efficient Bayesian method for discovering the local causal
  relationships among triplets of (normally distributed) variables. In our approach,
  we score the patterns in the covariance matrix in one go and we incorporate the
  available background knowledge in the form of priors over causal structures. Our
  method is flexible in the sense that it allows for different types of causal structures
  and assumptions. We apply the approach to the task of inferring gene regulatory
  networks by learning regulatory relationships between gene expression levels. We
  show that our algorithm produces stable and conservative posterior probability estimates
  over local causal structures that can be used to derive an honest ranking of the
  most meaningful regulatory relationships. We demonstrate the stability and efficacy
  of our method both on simulated data and on real-world data from an experiment on
  yeast.
