title: Differential networking with path weights in Gaussian trees
abstract: Marginal and partial correlations quantify the strength of the associations
  represented by the edges of a graphical Gaussian model. The identification of changes
  in these quantities across different multivariate distributions, defined on the
  same vector of random variables, is often used to analyze regulatory networks in
  molecular biology, doing what is popularly known as differential networking, or
  differential coexpression analysis. However, the strength of associations along
  the paths of a graphical model has remained largely unexplored in this type of analysis.
  Here we investigate how to quantify this strength over the paths of a Gaussian tree,
  leading to a factorization of what we shall call path weights. We show that tree
  structures allow for an intuitive interpretation of path weights and that the proposed
  factorization conveys information that is not captured by marginal or partial correlations
  alone. Path weights can help to improve our understanding of a multivariate system
  under study and provide a new tool for differential coexpression analysis.
