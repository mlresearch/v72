title: Privacy Sensitive Construction of Junction Tree Agent Organization for Multiagent
  Graphical Models
abstract: Junction trees (JTs) are not only effective structures for single-agent
  probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), but also effective agent organizations in
  multiagent graphical models, such as multiply sectioned Bayesian networks. A natural
  decomposition of agent environment may not allow construction of a JT organization.
  Hence, re-decomposition of the environment is necessary. However, re-decomposition
  incurs loss of agent privacy that ultimately translates to loss of intellectual
  property of agent suppliers. We propose a novel algorithm DAER (Distributed Agent
  Environment Re-decomposition) that re-decomposes the environment to enable a JT
  organization and incurs significantly less privacy loss than existing JT organization
  construction methods.
