title: Cascading Sum-Product Networks using Robustness
abstract: Sum-product networks are an increasingly popular family of probabilistic
  graphical models for which marginal inference can be performed in polynomial time.
  They have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several tasks. When
  learning sum-product networks from scarce data, the obtained model may be prone
  to robustness issues. In particular, small variations of parameters could lead to
  different conclusions. We discuss the characteristics of sum-product networks as
  classifiers and study the robustness of them with respect to their parameters. Using
  a robustness measure to identify (possibly) unreliable decisions, we build a hierarchical
  approach where the classification task is deferred to another model if the outcome
  is deemed unreliable.  We apply this approach on benchmark classification tasks
  and experiments show that the robustness measure can be a meaningful manner to improve
  classification accuracy.
