title: Bayesian Network Structure Learning with Side Constraints
abstract: Hybrid methods for Bayesian network structure learning that incorporate
  both observed data and expert knowledge have proven to be important in many fields.
  Previous studies have presented both exact and approximate hybrid methods for structure
  learning. In this paper, we propose an approximate method based on local search
  that is capable of efficiently handling a variety of prior knowledge constraints,
  including an important class of non-decomposable \emph{ancestral} constraints that
  assert indirect causation between random variables. In our experiments, our proposed
  approximate method is able to significantly outperform an existing state-of-the-art
  approximate method in finding feasible solutions when \emph{hard constraints} are
  imposed. Our approach is able to find near-optimal networks while scaling up to
  almost fifty random variables. In contrast, previous exact methods are unable to
  handle more than twenty random variables. Furthermore, we show that when prior knowledge
  is integrated, we are often able to produce a network much closer to the ground
  truth network, particularly when the amount of data is limited.
