title: Learning Bayesian Networks by Branching on Constraints
abstract: We consider the Bayesian network structure learning problem, and present
  a new algorithm for enumerating the $k$ best Markov equivalence classes. This algorithm
  is score-based, but uses conditional independence constraints as a way to describe
  the search space of equivalence classes. The techniques we use here can potentially
  lead to the development of score-based methods that deal with more complex domains,
  such as the presence of latent confounders or feedback loops. We evaluate our algorithmâ€™s
  performance on simulated continuous data.
