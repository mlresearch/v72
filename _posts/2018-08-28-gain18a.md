title: Structure Learning Under Missing Data
abstract: Causal discovery is the problem of learning the structure of a graphical
  causal model that approximates the true generating process that gave rise to observed
  data. In practical problems, including in causal discovery problems, missing data
  is a very common issue. In such cases, learning the true causal graph entails estimating
  the full data distribution, samples from which are not directly available. Attempting
  to instead apply existing structure learning algorithms to samples drawn from the
  observed data distribution, containing systematically missing entries, may well
  result in incorrect inferences due to selection bias. Inthis paperwe discuss adjustmentsthat
  mustbemade toexistingstructure learningalgorithms to properly account for missing
  data. We first give an algorithm for the simpler setting where the underlying graph
  is unknown, but the missing data model is known. We then discuss approaches to the
  much more difficult case where only the observed data is given with no other additional
  information on the missingness model known. We validate our approach by simulations,
  showing that it outperforms standard structure learning algorithms in all of these
  settings.
