title: 'Prometheus : Directly Learning Acyclic Directed Graph Structures for Sum-Product
  Networks'
abstract: In this paper, we present Prometheus, a graph partitioning based algorithm
  that creates multiple variable decompositions efficiently for learning Sum-Product
  Network structures across both continuous and discrete domains. Prometheus proceeds
  by creating multiple candidate decompositions that are represented compactly with
  an acyclic directed graph in which common parts of different decompositions are
  shared. It eliminates the correlation threshold hyperparameter often used in other
  structure learning techniques, allowing Prometheus to learn structures that are
  robust in low data regimes. Prometheus outperforms other structure learning techniques
  in 30 discrete and continuous domains. We also describe a sampling based approximation
  of Prometheus that scales to high-dimensional domains such as images.
