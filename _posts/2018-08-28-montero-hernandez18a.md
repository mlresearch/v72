title: Intervals of Causal Effects for Learning Causal Graphical Models
abstract: Structure learning algorithms aim to retrieve the true causal structure
  from a set of observations. Most times only an equivalence class can be recovered
  and a unique model cannot be singled out. We hypothesized that casual directions
  could be inferred from the assessment of the strength of potential causal effects
  and such assessment can be computed by intervals comparison strategies. We introduce
  SLICE (Structural Learning with Intervals of Causal Effects), a new algorithm to
  decide on unresolved relations, which taps on the computation of causal effects
  and an acceptability index; a strategy for intervals comparison. For validation
  purposes, synthetic datasets were generated varying the graph size and density with
  samples drawn from Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions. Comparison against LiNGAM
  is made to establish the performance of SLICE over $1440$ scenarios using the normalised
  structural Hamming distance (SHD). The retrieved structures with SLICE showed smaller
  SHD values in the Gaussian case, improving the structure of the retrieved causal
  model in terms of correctly found directions. The acceptability index is a good
  predictor of the true causal effects ($R^2=0.62$). The proposed strategy represents
  a new tool for discovering unravelled causal relations in the presence of observational
  data only.
