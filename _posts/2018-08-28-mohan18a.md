title: Consistent Estimation given Missing Data
abstract: 'This paper presents a unified approach for recovering causal and probabilistic
  queries using graphical models given missing (or incomplete) data. To this end,
  we develop a general algorithm that can recover conditional probability distributions
  and conditional causal effects in semi-Markovian models. '
