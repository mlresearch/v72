title: Sparse Learning in Gaussian Chain Graphs for State Space Models
abstract: The graphical lasso is a popular method for estimating the structure of
  undirected Gaussian graphical models from data by penalized maximum likelihood.
  This paper extends the idea of structure estimation of graphical models by penalized
  maximum likelihood to Gaussian chain graph models for state space models. First
  we show how the class of linear Gaussian state space models can be interpreted in
  the chain graph set-up under both the LWF and AMP Markov properties, and we demonstrate
  how sparsity of the chain graph structure relates to sparsity of the model parameters.
  Exploiting this relation we propose two different penalized maximum likelihood estimators
  for recovering the chain graph structure from data depending on the Markov interpretation
  at hand. We frame the penalized maximum likelihood problem in a missing data set-up
  and carry out estimation in each of the two cases using the EM algorithm. The common
  E-step is solved by smoothing, and we solve the two different M-steps by utilizing
  existing methods from high dimensional statistics and convex optimization.
