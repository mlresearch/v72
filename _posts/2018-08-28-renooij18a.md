title: 'Same-Decision Probability: Threshold Robustness and Application to Explanation'
abstract: The same-decision probability (SDP) is a confidence measure for threshold-based
  decisions. In this paper we detail various properties of the SDP that allow for
  studying its robustness to changes in the threshold value upon which a decision
  is based. In addition to expressing confidence in a decision, the SDP has proven
  to be a useful tool in other contexts, such as that of information gathering. We
  demonstrate that the properties of the SDP as established in this paper allow for
  its application in the context of explaining Bayesian network classifiers as well.
