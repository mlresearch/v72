title: An Empirical Study of Methods for SPN Learning and Inference
abstract: In this study, we provide an empirical comparison of methods for \emph{sum-product
  network} (SPN) learning and inference. LearnSPN is a popular algorithm for learning
  SPNs that utilizes chop and slice operations. As \emph{g-test} is a standard chopping
  method and \emph{Gaussian mixture models} (GMM) using expectation-maximization is
  a common slicing method, it seems to have been assumed in the literature that this
  is the best pair in LearnSPN. On the contrary, our results show that g-test for
  chopping and \emph{k-means} for slicing yields SPNs that are just as accurate. Moreover,
  it has been shown that implementing SPN leaf nodes as \emph{Chow-Liu Trees} (CLTs)
  yields more accurate SPNs for the former pair. Our experiments show the same for
  the latter pair, and that neither pair dominates the other. Lastly, we report an
  analysis of SPN topology for unstudied pairs. With respect to inference, we derive
  \emph{partial propagation} (PP), which performs SPN exact inference without requiring
  a full propagation over all nodes in the SPN as currently done. Experimental results
  on SPN datasets demonstrate that PP has several advantages over full propagation
  in SPNs, including relative time savings, absolute time savings in large SPNs, and
  scalability.
